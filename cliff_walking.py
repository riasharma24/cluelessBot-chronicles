        Compute the discounted returns at each timestep,
        as the sum of the gamma-discounted return at time t (G_t) + the reward at time t

        In O(N) time, where N is the number of time steps
        (this definition of the discounted return G_t follows the definition of this quantity
        shown at page 44 of Sutton&Barto 2017 2nd draft)
        G_t = r_(t+1) + r_(t+2) + ...

        Given this formulation, the returns at each timestep t can be computed
        by re-using the computed future returns G_(t+1) to compute the current return G_t
        G_t = r_(t+1) + gamma*G_(t+1)
        G_(t-1) = r_t + gamma* G_t
        (this follows a dynamic programming approach, with which we memorize solutions in order
        to avoid computing them multiple times)

        This is correct since the above is equivalent to (see also page 46 of Sutton&Barto 2017 2nd draft)
        G_(t-1) = r_t + gamma*r_(t+1) + gamma*gamma*r_(t+2) + ...


        Given the above, we calculate the returns at timestep t as:
            gamma[t] * return[t] + reward[t]

        We compute this starting from the last timestep to the first, in order
        to employ the formula presented above and avoid redundant computations that would be needed
        if we were to do it from first to last.

        Hence, the queue "returns" will hold the returns in chronological order, from t=0 to t=n_steps
        thanks to the appendleft() function which allows to append to the position 0 in constant time O(1)
        a normal python list would instead require O(N) to do this.
